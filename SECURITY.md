## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any security issues via email to security@getontracks.org. If you don't get a reply for your email, resend the email after one week. If there's still no reply, open an issue in the issue queue but *do not disclose the details* in the issue, only ask about the reply and status.

Unfortunately Tracks is not part of a bug bounty program, but we do provide appropriate credits for disclosing security issues.
